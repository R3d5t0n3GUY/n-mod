*********************************************************** TODO *****************************************************
•Print todo.txt in the updates div as paragraph
•Integrate sword, scythe, spear, sniper shells, and MRFF as their own bullets, rather than being defined in their respective guns
•Implement image generation for microtransaction tech option [dependent on the skin chosen for said option]
•Fix Genisis (arena boss) immunity bug
•Fix sniper gun map bug (whereby the map collisions randomly bug out if the gun is in the player's inventory)
•HEAVILY nerf MRFF damage (bc right now, it one-taps everything [except Genisis, see above] even if target is shielded or immune)
•Fix ace (the boss in the "ace" level, not the one in crimsonTowers or the level "ace" itself) attack bug (probably a typo)
•Add bossbar for boundaryBoss

•...and any bugs YOU guys find!
